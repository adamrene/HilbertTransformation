	/// Find an optimal HilbertIndex for a given set of points.
	/// 
	/// Many HilbertIndex objects are created for the same set of points, each with a different permutation
	/// used in performing the Hilbert transformation on the points. Each permutation will cause the 
	/// points to be sorted in a different order. Some of these curves are better than others at visiting
	/// a cluster of points, moving from point to point within the cluster, then advancing to the next cluster
	/// without doubling back later to a cliuster already visited.
	/// 
	/// If the curve revisits a cluster multiple times after visiting other clusters, then that index is fragmented.
	/// The more fragmented an index is, the poorer the performance when we do an exhaustive construction 
	/// of the clusters. Whatever measure is used of quality should correlate well with the number of
	/// stripes found in the index. For example, if there are ten true clusters but the index finds twenty
	/// clusters, our fragmentation factor is two.
	/// 
	/// The metric used to evaluate the quality of the many indices to be tested may be supplied by the caller,
	/// as well as the strategy for randomizing the permutation used.
